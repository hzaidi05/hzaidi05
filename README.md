## I'm Hamza Zaidi, a Computer Engineering student @ UWaterloo

I enjoy a wide variety of topics, but I'm currently interested in:
- Machine Learning Systems and Performance
- Distributed Systems and Databases
- GPU architecture
- Infrastructure and Backend

Talk to me about CUDA (or anything else!) at `hamza[dot]zaidi[at]uwaterloo[dot]ca`
